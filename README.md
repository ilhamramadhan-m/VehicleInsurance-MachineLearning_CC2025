# ðŸš— Vehicle Insurance Customer Segmentation & Claim Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project utilizes the **Vehicle Insurance Customer Data** from Kaggle to extract insights using both **clustering (unsupervised learning)** and **classification (supervised learning)**. The objective is twofold:
- Identify distinct customer segments based on demographic and behavioral attributes.
- Predict whether a customer will claim vehicle insurance based on their profile.

This analysis is performed as part of the final submission for the **Belajar Machine Learning Pemula (BMLP)** program.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
[Vehicle Insurance Customer Data â€” Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data/data)

The dataset contains features such as:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Region, Driving License
- **Vehicle Info**: Previously insured, vehicle age, damage history
- **Policy Info**: Annual premium, policy sales channel
- **Target Variable**: `Response` â€” indicates if the customer showed interest in vehicle insurance
